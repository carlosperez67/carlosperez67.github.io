                        <br />
                        Iâ€™m currently completing my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, driven by a passion for using technology to tackle real-world challenges and make a lasting impact. My goal? To blend innovation with purpose and push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in software development.

                        <br />
                        When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me out in the wild! As an avid skier, rock climber, and hiker, Iâ€™m constantly on the hunt for new peaks to conquer and trails to explore. The resilience and problem-solving mindset I bring to my outdoor adventures also fuel my approach to technologyâ€”whether itâ€™s scaling a mountain or tackling a challenging project, Iâ€™m all in.

                        <br />
                        In the ever-evolving field of software development, I believe adaptability and a thirst for learning are essential. Iâ€™m enthusiastic about collaborating with others, sharing ideas, and diving into new challenges that push me out of my comfort zone.

                        Iâ€™m open to opportunities, networking, and discussions on all things tech. Whether youâ€™re working on an exciting project or just looking to connect, feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™m eager to chat!
